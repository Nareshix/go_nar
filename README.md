I need to start documenting to not get confused after not touching this project for a while

# Files

main.go works
download.go installs deb, tar, and download link so far (more testing needed)
fetch.go works from fetching data from repos.db


so far download done
update, delete is needed


//todo
proper err handling if no apps is given, currenlty for uninstall nth is displayed
